            There are 7 tiles called 'Tetrominos' that the user can move across
            the screen as well as rotate. The goal of the game is to bring the
            tiles down to the bottom of the screen gaining points by clearing
            rows. Left arrow key moves left, right arrow key moves right, down
            key moves the piece down quicker, up rotates the piece to the right,
            and the x key rotates the piece to the left.
